paperboy
========

Server for compiling and sending the calibre news. Get Calibre here http://calibre-ebook.com and install it.

This application consists of two tools. The paperboy.py server application which sends all defined jobs at 11:00 to the defined mail address. And the paperboy-config.py configuration application, to change the settings and delete or create new jobs.

Please be aware that this project is merely in an alpha stage so be aware that there may be lots of bugs hidden, i would appreciate if you report them. I am also open to suggestions of new features.

## TODO

- [ ] Allow job individual execution time.
- [ ] Implement daily, weekly or monthly intervals
